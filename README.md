This app connects to a web service to retrieve and display the Mars photos. The images are real-life photos from Mars captured from NASA's Mars rovers.
Here were used:
-> Android architecture components like ViewModel and LiveData.
-> Data Binding Library and Binding Adapters.
-> The Retrofit library to connect to a REST web service on the internet and get a response.
-> The Moshi library to parse the JSON response into a data object.
-> The Coil library to load and display an image from a web URL.
-> The RecyclerView and a grid adapter to display a grid of images.
